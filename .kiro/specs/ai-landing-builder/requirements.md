# AI Landing Page Builder - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Landing Page Builder is a conversational interface that allows users to create professional landing pages through natural language prompts. Similar to Lovable/Bolt, users describe what they want and the AI instantly generates Next.js components in real-time. The system leverages DeepSeek API for code generation and provides an intuitive chat-based workflow for non-technical users to build high-quality landing pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Conversational AI Interface

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want to create landing pages by describing what I need in plain English, so that I can build professional websites without coding knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a natural language prompt THEN the system SHALL interpret the request and generate appropriate Next.js components
2. WHEN a user provides follow-up instructions THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous prompts and apply changes incrementally
3. WHEN a user makes conflicting requests THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about constraints and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN the AI processes a request THEN the system SHALL display processing status and estimated completion time
5. IF a prompt is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Component Generation

**User Story:** As a user building a landing page, I want to see my changes appear instantly as I make requests, so that I can iterate quickly and see results immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a component THEN the preview SHALL update within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a component is modified THEN the system SHALL preserve existing content unless explicitly requested to change it
3. WHEN generating components THEN the system SHALL create valid TypeScript React components following Next.js 14+ best practices
4. WHEN creating responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL automatically implement mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
5. IF component generation fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggest corrections

### Requirement 3: DeepSeek API Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to use DeepSeek API for reliable code generation, so that users get consistent, high-quality components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API with proper authentication and rate limiting
2. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL validate output for Next.js compatibility before rendering
4. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and notify users of delays
5. IF API responses contain errors THEN the system SHALL sanitize and present user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 4: Live Preview System

**User Story:** As a user creating a landing page, I want to see a live preview of my page with device responsiveness, so that I can ensure it looks good on all screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL provide desktop, tablet, and mobile view toggles
2. WHEN hovering over components THEN the system SHALL highlight editable elements with visual indicators
3. WHEN components update THEN the preview SHALL use Next.js Fast Refresh for instant updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error overlays without breaking the preview
5. IF the preview fails to load THEN the system SHALL show fallback content and error details

### Requirement 5: Project Management

**User Story:** As a user building multiple landing pages, I want to save, organize, and export my projects, so that I can manage my work efficiently and deploy when ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL automatically save conversation history and generated components
2. WHEN exporting a project THEN the system SHALL generate a complete, deployable Next.js application
3. WHEN managing projects THEN the system SHALL provide project listing, renaming, and deletion capabilities
4. WHEN working on a project THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for rollback capabilities
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and manual download options

### Requirement 6: Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing generated code, I want components to follow modern React patterns and Next.js conventions, so that the output is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating components THEN the system SHALL create them in the `app/components` directory with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN creating layouts THEN the system SHALL properly separate server and client components
3. WHEN handling images THEN the system SHALL use `next/image` for automatic optimization
4. WHEN generating styles THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules or Tailwind classes for scoped styling
5. IF components have dependencies THEN the system SHALL properly import and configure required packages

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Performance

**User Story:** As an end user visiting generated landing pages, I want them to be accessible and fast-loading, so that I have a good experience regardless of my abilities or device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating components THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
2. WHEN creating interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure keyboard navigation support
3. WHEN selecting colors THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and code splitting where appropriate
5. IF accessibility issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for improvements
